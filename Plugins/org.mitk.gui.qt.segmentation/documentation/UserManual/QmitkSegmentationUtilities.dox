\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesManualOverview Overview

The <b>Segmentation Utilities View</b> allows to postprocess existing segmentations. Currently five different operations exist:

<ul>
	<li> \ref org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesBooleanOperations
	<li> \ref org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesContourToImage
	<li> \ref org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesImageMasking
	<li> \ref org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesMorphologicalOperations
	<li> \ref org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesSurfaceToImage
</ul>

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesDataSelection Data Selection

All postprocessing operations provide one or more selection widgets, which allow to select the data for the operation.

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesBooleanOperations Boolean operations

Boolean operations allows to perform the following fundamental operations on two segmentations:

<ul>
	<li> <b>Difference:</b> Subtracts the second segmentation from the first segmentation.
	<li> <b>Intersection:</b> Extracts the overlapping areas of the two selected segmentations.
	<li> <b>Union:</b> Combines the two existing segmentations.
</ul>

The selected segmentations must have the same geometry (size, spacing, ...) in order for the operations to work correctly.
The result will be stored in a new data node as a child node of the first selected segmentation.

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesContourToImage Contour to image

Contour to image allows to create a segmentation out of a given contour-model.
The operation requires a contour model set and a reference image.
The created segmentation image will have the same geometrical properties like the reference image (dimension, size and Geometry3D).

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesImageMasking Image masking

Image masking allows to mask an image with either an existing segmentation or a surface.
The operation requires an image and a segmentation or a surface.
The result will be an image containing only the pixels that are covered by the respective mask.

The default background pixel value is zero.
It can be changed to the minimum existing pixel value of the image or to a custom pixel value.
If the custom pixel value is out of the valid bounds of the pixel type, it is optionally clamped accordingly.

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesMorphologicalOperations Morphological operations

Morphological operations are applied to a single segmentation image. Based on a given structuring element the underlying segmentation will be modfied.
The plugin provides a <b>ball</b> and a <b>cross</b> as structuring elements. The follow operations are available:

<ul>
	<li> <b>Dilation:</b> Each labeled pixel within the segmentation will be dilated based on the selected structuring element.
	<li> <b>Erosion:</b> Each labeled pixel within the segmentation will be eroded based on the selected structuring element.
	<li> <b>Opening:</b> A dilation followed by an erosion, used for smoothing edges or eliminating small objects.
	<li> <b>Closing:</b> An erosion followed by an dilation, used for filling small holes.
	<li> <b>Fill Holes:</b> Fills bigger holes within a segmentation.
</ul>

\section org_mitk_views_segmentationUtilitiesSurfaceToImage Surface to image

Surface to image allows to create a segmentation out of a given surface.
The operation requires a surface and a reference image.
The created segmentation image will have the same geometrical properties like the reference image (dimension, size and Geometry3D).
